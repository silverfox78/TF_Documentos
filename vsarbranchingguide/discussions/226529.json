    "Html": "<p>Ren&eacute;,</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your response. I can now respond more specifically to your questions.</p>\r\n<p>1. With respect to the drawing for Fig. 1 in the Main Guide. This is how I prefer to show the *merge* direction between the RELEASE and MAIN branches. <br>If you look at PowerPoint slide 5 of the TFS Branching Guide - Diagrams 2010, you will see that we now label the arrow to better explain its purpose. <br>In our next refresh we will use this latest diagram in all of the document illustrations to be clearer and more consistent.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;Fig. 1 in the HOL Quick Start Guide will change in the next refresh, as noted above.</p>\r\n<p>3. Fig. 1 in the Branching Guide Scenarios document *intentionally* omits the release branching. In this scenario, for better or worse, we wanted to focus more on the detail and process for branching for a single development team. Here we wanted to show examples of labeling and merges over time. We chose to use a scenario for this purpose, rather than the main document so as to keep the main guidance more succinct and straight forward. Our goal is to use the scenarios to drill into more detail or to show additional variations beyond the branch plans presented in the Main Guidance. For example, in the next release, we may add a scenario to illustrate various options for sharing common code between projects. I welcome your feed back.</p>\r\n<p>In addtion, I have found that many other branching and merging whitepapers tend not to separate the development side of the branching plan from the release side of the branching plan. There are times when the development branches are influenced by how an organization releases software. But often the development branches are intended to provide isolation during the development process while the release branches are intended to support software releases and sustained egineering. In other words, you may have a simpler development branch structure (to support a single team)&nbsp;coupled with a more complex release structure (to support multiple released versions with hotfix and service pack support). Conversely, there may be a need for multiple development teams coupled with a simpler release branch structure. The intent of the first scenario was to focus primarily on development. For that reason we omitted the release branches to help make the point that there can be this separation.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again for your feedback.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>Bill Heys <br>VS ALM Ranger</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is likely that, in the future, we may add more scenarios on diifferent topics that don't necessarily relate to the branching plans described in the Main document. It is also possible that we may consolidate some scenarios into the Main document. If you feel that creating a matrix is helpful to you, you should feel free to do so. If you are finding confusion reading both the Main document and the Scenarios document, focus primarily on the Main document.

    "Html": "<p>A key&nbsp;mission of the VS ALM Rangers is to provide guidance and best practices around the use of Microsoft tools, in this case VS Team Foundation Server. Many folks have found the branching guidance to be quite valuable when using other SCM tools. However, as a volunteer group, we simply do not have the time to create general guidelines and then extend these to TFS. I am sure if you do some research on SCM you will find lots more general guidance as well as guidance on other vendor's tools.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>Bill</p>",
