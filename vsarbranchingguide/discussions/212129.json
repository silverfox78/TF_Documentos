    "Html": "<p>I don't suppose there is ever one *correct* answer for all scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>Your question probably raises more questions than answers:</p>\r\n<p>Do you release different versions of a plugin at different times. For example, if your product has ten plugins, and you release a new version of the product, would you be releasing new versions of the plugins at the same time, on the same release cycle. Or is it possible to release a plugin on a different release cycle than the product?</p>\r\n<p>My first inclination would to have all the code related to a product (and it's plugins) all contained within one TeamProject. I would not have a separate Team Project for each plugin unless these plugins are shared across products.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>Bill Heys<br>VS ALM Ranger</p>",
