    "Html": "<p>What version of TFS are you using.</p>\r\n<p>If I correctly understand what you have done, you have moved code in the Main branch from one folder to another. I believe this effectively deletes the files from the source folder of the move (Installation) and adds the files to the target folder of the move (Deployment). TFS will not automatically recognize that the files have moved from one folder to another and *adjust* automatically. I don't think TFS will ever know that these folders are the same (unless you did a rename rather than a move).</p>\r\n<p>I should also caution you that one of the biggest headaches I have encountered is around file renaming, and / or file deletes and adds with the same name.&nbsp;This especially challenging in TFS 2008, but also&nbsp;manifests issues when&nbsp;migrating from TFS 2008 to TFS 2010,</p>\r\n<p>Would it have been better to rename the Installation folder to Deployment (perhaps in both the main as well as the release branches)?</p>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>Bill Heys <br>VS ALM Ranger</p>",
