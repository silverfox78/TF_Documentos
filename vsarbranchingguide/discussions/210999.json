    "Html": "<p>Paolo,</p>\r\n<p>With respect to hotfixes, the general recommendation is, as you suggest, to send only the changed DLL(s) to a customer that fix THAT customer's problem. Hotfixes are sometimes called Quick Fix Engineering (QFEs). Generally a hotfix is not as exhaustively tested as a full release or Service Pack. For this reason most customers are advised not to install a specific hotfix unless they believe it is a fix to a problem they are experiencing.</p>\r\n<p>In my view a Service Pack is the vehicle that creates a cumulative patch. You might combine several individual hotfixes into a Service Pack. Service Packs SHOULD be thoroughly tested (similar to a full release) since they will have broad distribution. I would NOT send a cumulutive patch containing several hotfixes UNLESS it undergoes rigorous testing.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Bill Heys<br>VS ALM Ranger</p>",
