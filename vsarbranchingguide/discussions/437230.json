It goes through different scenarios of sharing source code, binaries, and 3rd party libraries.\r<br />\n<br />\nBranching vs Not branching comes down to how often the libraries and blob assets change. If they don't change that often, you may just want to create a folder for each version and reference or update them when needed. You need to create a dedicated team project for you shared assets.\r<br />\n<br />\nLet me know if you need more info. \r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nAhmed<br />\n",

However also take a look at NuGet and NuGet package restore as a potential solution for dependency management which can in fact get you away from putting binaries in the tree to begin with.<br />\n",
