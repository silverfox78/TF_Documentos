Issue came from the merging files changed in both Hotfix and Servicing branches.\r<br />\n<img src=\"http://i60.tinypic.com/22de9v.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\r<br />\n<br />\nAs a result following change to the branching strategy was suggested:\r<br />\n<img src=\"http://i59.tinypic.com/kdakux.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\r<br />\n<br />\nThat approach will address cherry picking issues, but will require lots of branches to deal with features, hotfixes and critical issues.\r<br />\n<br />\nI was hoping to get an advice and rational explanation which option should be the best choice for our situation.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you!<br />\n",
