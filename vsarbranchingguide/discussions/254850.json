I'm just getting my first exposure to TFS, and it has all been very helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Our company was recently acquired, and as part of the &quot;integration&quot;, we will be migrating our SCM from CVS to TFS2010. &nbsp;Previously, our source code structure was very simple, but mostly inflexible. &nbsp;NEW COMPANY has some loose guidelines that we\r\n need to follow, but there is a particular area where I haven't been able to nail down a good answer.</p>\r\n<p>It has to do with common source libraries that are shared across projects. &nbsp;Given the following structure:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<pre>$/FirstApplication/\r\n  Main/\r\n    Src/\r\n      FirstApp/\r\n        Src/\r\n          FirstAppWeb/\r\n          FirstAppSpecificClassLibrary/\r\n      SharedBinaries/\r\n        logger.dll\r\n\r\n$/SecondApplication/\r\n  Main/\r\n    Src/\r\n      SecondApp/\r\n        Src/\r\n          SecondAppWeb/\r\n          SecondAppSpecificClassLibrary/\r\n      SharedBinaries/\r\n        logger.dll\r\n\r\n$/CommonClassLibraries/\r\n  Main/\r\n    Src/\r\n      CommonClassLibrary1/\r\n        Src/\r\n          CommonClassLibrary1/ &lt;--VS project is here\r\n      CommonClassLibrary2/\r\n        Src/\r\n          CommonClassLibrary2/ &lt;--VS project is here\r\n      SharedBinaries/\r\n        SpecialFunctions.dll\r\n</pre>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Let's say that I want to use CommonClassLibrary1 in both FirstApp and SecondApp. My plan would be to branch something like:</p>\r\n<p>$/CommonClassLibraries/Main/Src/CommonClassLibrary1 -&gt;$/FirstApplication/Main/Src/Firstapp/Src/Common/CommonClassLibrary1</p>\r\n<p>and</p>\r\n<p>$/CommonClassLibraries/Main/Src/CommonClassLibrary1 -&gt;$/FirstApplication/Main/Src/Secondapp/Src/Common/CommonClassLibrary1</p>\r\n<p>First of all, as a TFS infant, is this structure sensible? It seems like I could still use the relative path that CommonClassLibrary1 has for SpecialFunctions.dll and make sure that SpecialFunctions.dll is copied into the SharedBinaries directory for Firstapp\r\n and Secondapp.</p>\r\n<p>However, what if the different CommonClassLibraries are or are not related for any business reason? Is it better to have each CommonClassLibary contain its own subdirectory of binary references? Something like:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<pre>$/CommonClassLibraries/\r\n  Main/\r\n    Src/\r\n      CommonClassLibrary1/\r\n        Src/\r\n          CommonClassLibrary1/ &lt;--VS project is here\r\n        Binaries/\r\n          SpecialFunctions.dll\r\n      CommonClassLibrary2/\r\n        Src/\r\n          CommonClassLibrary2/ &lt;--VS project is here\r\n        Binaries/\r\n          SpecialFunctions.dll\r\n</pre>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>But this seems like a lot more effort to track.</p>\r\n<p>Hope I didn't ramble too much. I'm just trying to use this migration as an opportunity to get rid of some less-than-best practices that we were guilty of.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>\r\n",
