The choice is Current (the default) or Check-in.\r<br />\nBe careful with this one. This setting sets the modified date of a file. If the setting is Current, on check-in the file keeps its modify date,When you choose Check-in, the file modify time is set to check-in time. So if you check-in files that you changed 3 days ago, the file time in TFS is now !<br />\n",
