But the last two places I used TFS, we used one single TFS Project to store all source control for our main products. And we ran all our projects out of that one TFS project.\r\n So all work items were comingled in one TFS project. We kept projects separate by using Iterations. Here is an example Iteration tree\r\n<div>-Projects</div>\r\n<div>----2012</div>\r\n<div>----2013</div>\r\n<div>-------Project A</div>\r\n<div>-------Project B</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>And we used the Area to designate different products.</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>IMHO, TFS would fit our world better if it could make its source control container more loosely coupled to the work item container, to represent that SOFTWARE PRODUCTS are not PROJECTS. Then we could have one source control container for every major software\r\n product. And one project container for every major work effort. Then if you could somehow link a project container to multiple product containers, we could check in changes to various products as part of a single task in the project.\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>On Wed, Jan 16, 2013 at 5:00 PM, PaulSomers <span dir=\"ltr\">&lt;<a href=\"mailto:notifications@codeplex.com\" target=\"_blank\">notifications@codeplex.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex; border-left:1px #ccc solid; padding-left:1ex\">\r\n<div>\r\n<p>From: PaulSomers</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>There was scenario that I do not see catered for, for projects before TFS, with other tools, we used to follow this method, can you perhaps help me out with some additional guidance.</p>\r\n<p>I have a client, they have several product streams, and some of these products talk to each other, and some parts of some products only exist to supplement a single product, some service several products…</p>\r\n<p>Our Example:</p>\r\n<p>SharePoint front end</p>\r\n<p>BizTalk Integration Layer</p>\r\n<p>External parties</p>\r\n<p>SQL Database project central store, shared.</p>\r\n<p>Other internal systems</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Firstly we run multiple projects at once, with multiple teams.</p>\r\n<p>We have source code for the various systems, they do interact with each other, some not all, and the integration layer between is considered a separate system, as we use an ESB concept where all interfaces are re-usable, as we do often 80% of the time re-use\r\n them.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>We have source code repository for these streams: </p>\r\n<p>Root</p>\r\n<p>\\SharePoint</p>\r\n<p>\\BizTalk</p>\r\n<p>\\Database(special name)</p>\r\n<p>\\Internal system1</p>\r\n<p>\\Internal system2</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Leaving aside from the branches, for main, dev, test and uat, and the whole management of branches for the moment…</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>We will have a project…..</p>\r\n<p>It will take branches from SOME, never all of the streams of source code.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Here is where it gets interesting…..</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>What we used to do, was make a team project in TFS for the project, because we can use the same source code, and take branches into our new TFS project, we take a branch of main into our TFS project for the Streams in this project.</p>\r\n<p>Two interesting parts:</p>\r\n<p>We may have another project…..

I thought that I had to have all my work initiatives (&quot;Projects&quot; in the business sense) share a single TFS Team Project in order to operate on a shared code base. After reading\r\n your message, I did an experiment on TFS 2012 and TFS 2010, and discovered what you already knew: I could create a separate TFS Project for every business project, yet still have source code in one place.
