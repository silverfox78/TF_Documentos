Branch $Top and create $Top-New (<em>accomplishes the cloning and hopefully maintains all checkin history</em>)</p>\r\n<p>2. Move $Top-New/Main/Dev/Source/Middleware/... to $Top-New/Main/Dev/Middleware/...&nbsp; (<em>gets rid of unneeded intermediate folder</em>)</p>\r\n<p>Has anyone perform an task such as this?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, BC</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
