I'm somewhat afraid the answer's going to be &quot;MS Visio&quot;, but have some hope still this can be done with TFS, Visual Studio, or some kind of extension.\r<br />\n<br />\nTo be clear, I'm looking for the feature that tools like TortoiseHg and SourceTree have, where you can see all commits on all branches in a certain timespan, and have a visualization of where commits/checkins merge code from one branch to another.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs something like that possible? Is it perhaps even in the guide and did I miss it?<br />\n",
