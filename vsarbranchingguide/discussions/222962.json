I've been working with them on our branching structure and at times I&nbsp;too seem to get lost in the&nbsp;features....and don't fully&nbsp;remember&nbsp;the WHY behind what we're doing&nbsp;in the tool. A quick re-reading of the guidance helps...but it sure would be nice&nbsp;to&nbsp;have a practical example that my developers&nbsp;can have in their visual studio environment.</p>\r\n<p>If you guys&nbsp;could&nbsp;create a Feature&nbsp;Builder lab that would&nbsp;be great. Heck even starting from the Create Team&nbsp;Project step all the way through to merge resolution would be even better.</p>\r\n<p>And possibly could you explain why you would use the&nbsp;create branch from existing source control option in the Team Project&nbsp;creation wizard...that'd be nice as well.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the guidance so far...it's saved our bacon more than once....just hoping to see&nbsp;even more practical&nbsp;training on TFS 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"width:1px;height:1px;overflow:hidden;top:0px;left:-10000px\">ï»¿</div>",

    "Html": "<p>Allen,</p>\r\n<p>With respect to to providing guidance and / or a HOL using Feature Builder, I would say that we would consider any delivery modes or formats that will improve the communities ability to consume and beneft from the guidance. I cannot, however, commit to any specific format without discussing this with the leadership of the VS ALM Rangers program. One of the goals, when we undertake a Ranger project, is to make it easy for people to contribute. We have found the Word format (with PDF and XPS options) to be a reasonable publishing format for codeplex. I am continuing to look at alternative (additional) formats such as Feature Builder and Compiled Help (CHM) files.</p>\r\n<p>With respect to a suggestion for a lab, the existing guidance contains a downloadable lab and sample files that has been well received. It can be used with any VS TFS 2010 environment (physical or virtual).</p>\r\n<p>I will respond to the rest of your question shortly.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>Bill Heys<br>VS ALM Ranger</p>",
