I must be confused because I was thinking that each sprint was a branch off of Main,\r\n with Main being the stable code base that moves forward.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">At any rate the question is how do they manage feature releases in sprints?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">The example is that you select 10 features for a sprint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">When you get to the end of a sprint, say it is time bound by the business, two features are not ready so you need to move them to the next sprint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">How do we merge and release the 8 ready to release features and hold the other 2 to later sprints.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">The code for the 2 not ready to go features is interwoven with the rest of the code in the sprint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Checkout some ideas on my blog: <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/billheys/archive/2011/01/19/branching-sprint-is-done-some-features-are-not.aspx\">\r\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/billheys/archive/2011/01/19/branching-sprint-is-done-some-features-are-not.aspx</a></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",
