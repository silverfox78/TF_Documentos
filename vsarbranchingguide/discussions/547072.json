MS Research did a great analysis here: <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=157290\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=157290</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nWe are currently thinking about a &quot;Main&quot; branch for each module and the framework and a &quot;Product Main&quot; that is nothing more than a composition of the NuGet packages from various sources pulled together and verified. This is still in the idea phase and a long way from implementation so I cannot share my experiences, but it's where we are looking.\r<br />\n<br />\nEven if people don't take it as far as we are thinking, I think that looking at multi-trunk would be beneficial for teams.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nDave<br />\n",
