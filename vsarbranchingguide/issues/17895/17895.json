    "Description": "Since this is a CodePlex project you should make the raw Word and image documents available so that we can modify them to fit the needs of our separate teams. \nÂ \nFor example, if my company is using the advanced branching plan, then I would want to remove the basic and standard plans from the documents I give them. Likewise, I would want to add my own section on version numbers that apply specifically to my project..",
