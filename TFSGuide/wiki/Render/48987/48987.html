<li>Microsoft Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)</li></ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>Although Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server does not provide scheduled builds out of the box, you can use the <b>TFSBuild</b> command to implement your own scheduled builds. This How To article walks you through the process of setting up a scheduled build by using the <b>TFSBuild</b> command and the Microsoft Windows&#174; Task Scheduler.  <br />

<h3>Objectives</h3><ul><li>Learn what a scheduled build is.</li>
<li>Create a scheduled build by using the <b>TFSBuild</b> command utility and the Windows Task Scheduler.</li></ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>It is highly important that a project development team to generate regular builds in order to get timely feedback from a test team as well as other stake holders. This can be achieved through the use of scheduled builds. You can choose to schedule your build on a nightly, weekly, biweekly, or on any other regular schedule depending upon your project scope and requirements.<br /> <br />Although the Team Build feature in TFS does not have support scheduled builds out of box, it does provide a <b>TFSBuild</b> command line utility that enables you to initiate team builds from the command line. You can use any scheduler, such as the Windows Task Scheduler, to run the <b>TFSBuild</b> command utility in order to start builds at regular intervals.<br />
<h3>Summary of Steps</h3><ul><li>Step 1 – Create and Test Your Build</li>
<li>Step 2 – Create the TFSBuild Command Line</li>

<li>Step 7 – Test the Scheduled Task</li></ul>

<h3>Before You Begin</h3>Make sure the account that runs your build service is assigned Start a build = Allow permission in TFS.<br />
<h3>Step 1 – Create and Test Your build</h3>In this step, you create a test build and make sure the team-build works from within Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  If the build does not work, you should fix it before moving on to the next step.<br />
<ol><li>Create a Microsoft Windows&#174; Form project that you can use for testing the build.</li>
<li>Build the project and make sure that it is working correctly. </li>
<li>Check your project into source control</li>
<li>Create a team build as follows:
<ol><li>In Team Explorer, right-click <b>Team Builds</b>, and then click <b>New Team Build Type.</b></li>
<li>Complete the self-explanatory <b>Team Build Type Creation Wizard.</b></li></ol></li>
<li>Perform the following steps to verify that the team build is working:
<ol><li>In Team Explorer, double-click the Team Build Project you just created</li>
<li>On the <b>Build</b> menu of the Visual Studio instance, click <b>Build Team Project <i>&lt;&lt;Your Team Build Name&gt;&gt;.</i></b></li>
<li>Confirm that the correct build type is selected and the click <b>Build</b> </li></ol></li>
<li>Review the build output and make sure that there are no errors in the build process</li></ol>
<br /><b>Important:</b> Make sure that your build services account (TFSService) has Full Control permission to the shared folder for the drops, as specified in the <b>Team Build Type Wizard</b>.<br />
<h3>Step 2 – Create the TFSBuild Command Line</h3>In this step, you create a command for the <b>TFSBuild</b> utility for the purpose of starting a build. <br />
<ol><li>As the TFSBuild command utility needs a number of parameters in order to start a build, you first need to determine the parameters to be used, as follows.
<ol><li><b>Team Foundation Server</b> – The TFS URL where the solutions being built are checked in.</li>
<li><b>Team Project</b> – The name of the team project which you want to build.</li>
<li><b>Build Type</b> – The build type that you created using the Build Type Wizard in Step 1.</li>
<li><b>Build Machine</b> – The name of the build server that you want to use for building your project. This is an optional parameter; by default, it uses the build server specified in the team build type. </li>
<li><b>Build Directory</b> – The path to the directory where the build occurs. This is an optional parameter; by default, it uses the path specified in the team build type.</li></ol></li>
<li>Create the build command as follows:</li></ol>
<br /><span class="codeInline"> TfsBuild start &lt;&lt;TeamFoundationServer&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;TeamProject&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;BuildTypeName&gt;&gt; </span><br /><br />If you plan to override the build machine name and build directory path specified while creating the build type, the command would then be as follows:<br /><br /><span class="codeInline"> TfsBuild start &lt;&lt;TeamFoundationServer&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;TeamProject&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;BuildTypeName&gt;&gt; /m:&lt;&lt;MachineName&gt;&gt; /d:&lt;&lt;BuildDirectory&gt;&gt; </span><br />
<h3>Step 3 – Test the TFSBuild Command Line</h3>In this step, you test that the TFSBuild command is working correctly.<br />
<ol><li>Open the Visual Studio command prompt</li>
<li>Type the <b>TfsBuild</b> command that you created in Step 2.</li>
<li>Review the output to make sure that no errors occurred and that the build was created successfully.</li></ol>

<h3>Step 4 – Create a Batch File</h3>In this step, you create a batch file that will be used for scheduling the builds.<br />
<ul><li>Open Microsoft Notepad and type following command; please note that the full path to the TFSBuild.exe file is specified so that it can run from Windows command prompt. The following is an example of the command: </li></ul>
<br /><span class="codeInline"> &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE\TFSBuild&quot; start &lt;&lt;TeamFoundationServer&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;TeamProject&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;BuildTypeName&gt;&gt; </span><br /><br />If you override the build machine and build directory path, the command in the batch file would be as follows:<br /><br /><span class="codeInline"> &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE\TFSBuild&quot; start &lt;&lt;TeamFoundationServer&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;TeamProject&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;BuildTypeName&gt;&gt; /m:&lt;&lt;BuildMachineName&gt;&gt; /d:&lt;&lt;BuildDirectoryPath&gt;&gt; </span><br />
<ul><li>Save the file as a batch file; for example, batchbuild.bat</li>
<li>Place the file in a build scripts folder in TFS server source control, for example <b>Main\Scripts.</b></li></ul>

<h3>Step 5 – Test the batch file</h3> In this step, you verify that the batch file you created works correctly.<br />
<ol><li>Open a Windows command prompt. - <b>Note:</b> Do not open a Visual Studio command prompt; by default the Windows scheduler will run the batch file in a Windows command prompt.</li>
<li>Start the batch file on the command line.</li>
<li>Ensure that the build works correctly without any errors.</li></ol>

<h3>Step 6 – Add a Scheduled Task</h3>In this step, you add a schedule task for running the build command at regular intervals as required by your project.<br />
<ol><li>Click <b>Start</b> and then click <b>Control Panel.</b></li>
<li>Select the <b>Scheduled Tasks</b> option and then click <b>Add Scheduled Tasks.</b></li>
<li>In the <b>Scheduled Task Wizard</b> click <b>Next.</b></li>
<li>Click <b>Browse</b> and select the batch file you created in Step 4, then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
<li>On this page, type the name of the task and select the frequency at which you want to run the tasks – for example, <b>Daily</b> and then click <b>Next</b></li>
<li>Configure the <b>Start time</b> and <b>Start date</b> and then click <b>Next.</b></li>
<li>Enter user name and password of an account with Start a build permissions and click <b>Next</b></li>
<li>Then click <b>Finish.</b></li></ol>

<h3>Step 7 – Test the Scheduled Task</h3>In this step, you verify that the scheduled task is running at the right time and that the build work properly.
<ol><li>Wait for the time at which the scheduled task should execute. -or- Click <b>Start</b> and then click <b>Control Panel,</b> then select <b>Scheduled Tasks</b> option, from the list right click on your scheduled task and select <b>Run</b>.  </li>
<li>A command prompt should appear and your build should start.</li>
<li>If you do not have access to the build machine at the time the task should execute, you can check back later and see if a build has completed:</li>
<li>In <b>Team Explorer</b> double-click <b>All Build Types</b>.</li>
<li>View the list of builds to see if a build is completed at the time you scheduled.</li></ol>
