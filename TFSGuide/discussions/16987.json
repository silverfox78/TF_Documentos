However, I would love to find out if there will be any migration support not just for an in-place upgrade from 2005-&gt;2008 or 2008 Beta 2 -&gt;2008 RTM, but some kind of real database import capability. I read that when you install and point to an existing 2005 database, the inplace upgrade will modify the schema. However, I haven't seen (a) an option to point to an existing database AFTER installing and performing the same inplace upgrade, or (b) an option to import data from an existing database into a new one either at installation or later....<br /><br />Basically, it seems to the only supported scenario right now is to perform an inplace upgrade to an existing database (or copy running under another instance) at installation time only....<br /><br /><br />",

    "Html": "\r\nI would agree with your assessment of supported scenario's. I was looking for the same options that you listed and did not find any official support for them. If you are not doing an inplace upgrade, you start to get into a migration scenario, and there are some options available there. However, you still have to update your database during the TFS install.<br /><br />We were actually in the process of setting up a new datacenter, so migration was something that had to be done anyway. I ended up doing an inplace upgrade of our current server, then doing a combination of things to move the data to a new server in a different domain. I have a writeup on my blog if anyone is interested (http://blog.salvoz.com/2007/10/21/InstallingTFS2008Beta2.aspx).  As I explain in my post, I was following this guide (http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404883(VS.80).aspx) along with blog posts and a little trial and error. <br />",
