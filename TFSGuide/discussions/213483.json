Is it advised to match the disk directory to your xx.xx.xx.xx naming convention of your projects?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So when I check in - it looks like I have two options:&nbsp; I could either do 1) &quot;Add Folder&quot; and pull in my whole &quot;Project&quot;Directory (with all children) at once,<br>or 2) I could open each solution and check it in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Neal Walters</p>",
