How well do the concepts in this guide map to TFS 2008.  Or is there a guide out there already and I am just not finding it?  I would assume most of the guide is still relevant, but I assume it is missing items that I would want to consider for my 2008 implementation?<br /><br />Thanks for any help you all may provide.<br />",
